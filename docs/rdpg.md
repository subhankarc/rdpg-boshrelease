# rdpg Project Specific Notes

##In bosh-lite 

For the first time to run bosh-lite or after reboot the laptop, do 
./bin/add-route in bosh-lite

vagrant destroy --force # destroy bosh-lite vms
vagrant up # run bosh-lite vms
bosh login admin admin # log in as admin

Remove old VM ssh keys when destroyed
vim ~/.ssh/known_hosts # delete the 6.* lines at the bottom

## Bosh Release
```sh
After vagrant destroy and up, do 
./rdpg-dev prepare warden ; bosh -n deploy

If it is on a new pull of boshrelease repo which you only have a rdpgd code change, do 
./rdpg-dev release ; bosh -n deploy

To delete a deployment
bosh -n delete deployment rdpg --force
```

SSH To a BOSH Deployed VM: bosh ssh {vm name} {vm index}, eg:
```sh
bosh ssh rdpg_manager/0 
bosh ssh rdpg_manager/1 
bosh ssh rdpg_cluster_1/0 
bosh ssh rdpg_cluster_1/1 
bosh ssh rdpg_cluster_1/2 
```
