Wait for bootstrapping to be completed for all clusters, perhaps have an admin 
api endpoint for /state that summarizes the state of the entire system as of that moment.

Get # of available instances on management database
> Ensure that # available on each cluster is >= N (20?)
> Ensure that mc available >= 2* pool_size

When mc available # is >= 2 * pool_size begin:
  Provision Instance
  > verify instances tables in both mc and sc for each node
  Bind Instance
  > validate binding & credentials is propigated MC & SC
  > FUTURE FEATURE: Bind creates new user on each instance for the database.
  Use Instance: Create table, connect direct to both cluster nodes and verify data is in both places.
  > verify connect, create schema & table, insert data, verify is replicated to each node
  Unbind Instance
  > validate that binding & credentials are set ineffective_at
  > FUTURE FEATURE: Unbind deletes user on each instance for the database.
  Deprovision Instance
  > Validate that ineffective_at is set on MC & SC.
  > Validate that can no longer connect using binding credentials via :5432 (through pgbouncer)

Provision #clusters * 2 instances, get # available, sleep 10 seconds :
  > Validate that # available is increasing, eg. more created on assignment.
